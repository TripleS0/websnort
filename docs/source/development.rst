===========
Development
===========

If you are interested in contributing to the project please read through
the following sections.

Websnort API
============

The codebase is quite simple with the execution logic defined in
`websnort.runner`: 

.. automodule:: websnort.runner
   :members: is_pcap, run
   :undoc-members:

Bottle App
----------

And the web handling, `bottle` routes defined in `websnort.web`:

.. automodule:: websnort.web
   :members: home, api_submit, submit_and_render
   :undoc-members:

IDS Plugins
-----------

Interfacing with other IDS systems is possible by implementing a new plugin.
The plugin can either be statically registered in *websnort.plugins.registry*
or hooked in at install time by defining the correct setuptools entrypoint in
your project.

See `websnort.runner.IDSRunner` for expected class API. 

.. automodule:: websnort.plugins
   :members: IDSRunner
   :undoc-members:
